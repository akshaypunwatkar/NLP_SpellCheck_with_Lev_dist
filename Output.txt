chapter 1





The family of Dashwood had long been settled i Sussex.

Their estate was large, and their residence was at Norlad Park,

in the centre of their property, where, for many generations,

they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage

the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance.

The late owner of this estate was a single man, who lived

to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his life,

had a constant companion nd housekeeper in his sister.

But her death, which happened ten years before his own,

produced a great alteration in his home; for to supply

her loss, he invited and received into his house the family

of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal inheritor

of the Norland estate, and te persons to whom he intended

to bequeath it.  In the society o his nephew and niece,

to the Norldand estate was not so really important as to

his sisters; for their forsung, independent of what might

arise to them from their father's inheriting that property,

could be bt small.  Their mother had nothing, and their

father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal;

for the remaining moiety of his first will's fortune was

also secured to her child, and he had only a life-interest

in it.



The old gentleman died: his will was read, and

like almost every other will, gave as much disappointment

as pleasure.  H was neither so unjust, nor so ungrateful,

as to leave his estate from his nephew;--but he left it to him

on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest.

Mr. Dashwood had wished por it more for the sake of his

wife and daughters pan for himself or his son;--but to
